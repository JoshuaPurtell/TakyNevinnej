- brief: clear and concise
- your audience is likely already drowning in information. 
- People pay attention to less information in order to cope with information glut.
- Why people overtalk
	- callousness, confidence, complicated, careless
	- need to be clear
	- analogy to comedy; you can't just make comedy happen. it needs to be planned. We hurt others when we pollute our communiques. Help mind-maps to add structure to ideas.
	- don't defer to the full version, present the version your audience needs. Paint the picture, tell the story. Human minds are designed to process stories, so you are cutting with the grain when you use them as a vehicle for information
- Talk is more like tennis and less like golf. 
	- Have to parse response in order to see if they understand.
- Use visuals, set ten-word agenda. 
	- emphasize subject, call to action, bullet points â€” make it exciting to read. Prepare description of what you do.
