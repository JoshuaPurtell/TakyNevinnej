- 5 motivators
- 6 levels of grit
- [Flow](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Flow/) is necessary but not sufficient. 1/4 of peak-performance picture. Need the foundation of [Grit](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Grit/), goal-setting, problem-solving, [Creativity](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Creativity/), motivation, learning skills in order for flow to be consistently activated and utilized. Flow can improve performance by 100-500%.
- Peak performance is getting things to work together rather than conflict. 
- Small "i" impossible — [Learned Helplessness](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Learned_Helplessness/) epitomized.
- Many people learn some of the strategies, but don't have it all, and don't have the full picture.
- We all have weaknesses which can derail us. 
- Our [Big Five](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Big_Five/) index is fixed in the short term (5-10 years to change), and can determine our path to peak performance. What works for an extrovert might not work for an introvert.

- Mind set: [Thalamic Gating](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Thalamic_Gating/), top-down [Predictive Coding](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Predictive_Coding/) gating. Creativity involves cycling through gating regimes? 
- Motivation is three/four things:
	- Extrinsic/Intrinsic motivators:
		- With performance, few levers. Attention and action. Combine them and you get a habit. A habit allows for unconscious, and therefore optimized, action. Motivation gives you focus for free. Curiosity also gives us focus for free— a type of motivation. Norepinephrine + dopamine. A little bit constitutes curiosity, and big bit is a lot (intersection of curiosities and executed action). Romantic love is a type of passion (curiosity). Once we couple to something bigger than ourselves, then we have purpose. Then we need autonomy and ability to act (mastery). Then we get flow.
		- Start with extrinsic until you get to enough money for needs + discretionary spending. Then move to intrinsic motivators.
		- Connect action with what you're foundationally interested in. You need to do what makes you passionate; it will shine through your work. Autonomy and mastery are what is missing most often. Purpose and curiosity can be cultivated in many contexts. You need these elements to energize work; try to get better and better. 
	- Grit:

- after motivators, need goals
	- mission level:
	- higher level (1-5years):
	- clear goals (daily action plans):
- grit: work when motivation runs out and the task at hand does not produce flow
	- resistance-type physical grit: regularly push yourself harder, so brain recognizes that increased energy level is possible
	- mental grit: control mental and emotional states
	- grit to be your best when at your worst
		- calms you down, redolent of [Miyamoto Musashi](https://kind-curie-8e7995.netlify.app/obsidian_port/Miyamoto_Musashi/)
	- grit to train weaknesses (unaligned w motivation)
	- grit to face your fear
	- grit to actively recover

- continual learning via books
	- flow states have triggers; it arrives when we are completely focused, especially when task demands all of our skills and a little more. So, it involves learning and demands learning. One must know how to learn in order to inhabit flow. 
	- books condense much more information per time/dollar cost than do blog posts/podcasts/etc.
	- books are where they keep the secrets.
	- let curiosity guide learning in a subject via books. take notes on what captures attention, as this will help neurochemicals to fire and rewire.

- creativity: steering our processes
	- ability to shift in state of consciousness
		- connecting ideas, produces dopamine when we recognize patterns
		- this can help us tune signal differentiation
		- add flow triggers
	- will need to be able to reinvent ourselves dozens of times throughout career.
	- idea generation and problem generation
- flow:
	- 500% more productive when in flow state, 200-500% better at learning, similar for empathy and general performance
