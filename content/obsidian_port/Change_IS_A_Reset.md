Rest:
	- what we do to recover from work. Rest is more than just lazing; it can be active â€” exercise, walking. It is a skill we can get better at, and it can help us be creative.
	- Rest can leverage the creative and powerful default mode network.
	- 5 hours of intense cognitive work, in 90 minute bursts. Treat this as a baseline. But the rest is essential; walking as active rest. Maybe 2 hours of low-intensity work? 
	- morning routines are essential. Best for solitary work, Ernest Hemingway. Need to set up the morning the night before so that everything comes easily. Stop work the previous day half-way through, to encourage your subconscious to process what comes next. That way you hit the ground running in the morning.
	- walking. Moving helps the creative juices. Exposure to nature helps a bit as well. Kant and Nietszche walked every day.
	- Weekly deep rest. Need a sense of control over rest. Have control over hobby time.
	- Athletics, walking. Psychological benefits to sporting; gives resilience, courage, ability to take risks. Sports help you win a nobel prize. [Victor Frankl](https://www.processingstochasticities.com/obsidian_port/Victor_Frankl/) and rock climbing. Give a sense of continuity to life with sports.
	- People waste years because they don't waste hours. Rest and relaxation. Make space for rest, planning out exactly what we'd like to do.
