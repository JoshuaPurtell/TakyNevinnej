- self-compassion (kind/warm/supportive + mindfulness of suffering + )
	- present and aware of painful emotions: mindfulness
	- not self-pity, needs to be grounded in common humanity. Recognize that all humans suffer. Ability to not feel alone.
	- self-compassion prepotentiates compassion for others.
	- taps into parasympathetic mammallian care system, releases oxytocin which allows for growth. Speak to ourselves as we'd speak to a friend.

- self-compassion allows us to render ourselves care and safety necessary for growth
	- Better sleep, learning, health, relatedness
	- makes an ally rather than an enemy of ourselves
	- fierce vs tender self-compassion
		- addresses needs
- How to experience self-compassion.
	- Directly
	- What would I say to a dear friend in the same situation
	- What would a caring friend do?
	- Follow the recipe: mindfulness + not alone in experience + give yourself kindness (touch, )
	- Compassionate mess: helps fear of failure with procrastination. The safety helps one learn from failure.
