Hi! I'm Josh, and I'm an undergrad student hoping to use this site as a way to share thoughts and personal experiences in an ethical way. One of the [core principals]() I've chosen to guide my thinking for the time being is nonviolence, and although I feel that certain social media (like [twitter]() and [linkedin]()) have use narrow cases which are not harmful to the user, I have yet to encounter a social medium capable of hosting thoughts and experiences to which I'd consider it responsible to draw others. Thence Taky Nevinnej was inspired.

But what's in the name? Taky Nevinnej owes its name to a scene in Good Soldier Schweik, where Schweik finds himself, along with many others, swept up under less-than-credible charges born from the wake of general paranoia which the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand had left across the Empire.

In English:

```
"I'm innocent, Sir! I'm innocent!"
"So was Jesus Christ, and they nevertheless crucified him. 
Never has it anywhere or for anyone mattered that a given person was innocent."
"But I'm no Jesus Christ! I'm actually innocent!"
```
I foreground both [Good Soldier Schweik]() and [Stoicism]() in my mind's eye, when orienting action. To quote C. Jung, "The fool is the precursor to the savior," and Schweik models exactly the kind of humility and earnestness which the fool-as-student must embody as he continuously grows in preparation for [Campbell's]() unexpected challenge. Of course, this scene does not necessarily highlight Schweik's folly, but instead adopts an amalgam of pessimism and optimism characteristic of Stoicism: our lot in life is to accept circumstances both good and bad, and concern ourselves only with making the best of them. If I had to capture my life orientation, it would be to embody Schweikian Stoicism. And so [Taky Nevinnej]() was born.

The site is divided into [shortform](), where I host most of my Saturday writings and the like, and whose contents I intend to update consistently; and [longform](), where I keep longer treatments which are reserved only for those works which I feel merit the investment of my time and about whose production timeline I make no promises.

In case you'd like to learn a bit about my work as a student, you can do so at a sister site which I keep for this purpose. [Here](/hidden/about_hidden/) be (mathematical) dragons.

If you want to use anything in the website build code, be my guest! I only ask that you [collaboration guidelines](/hidden/collaboration_guidelines_hidden/) first.

N.B. Taky Nevinnej is currently in build 0.0.1. This means that it is in a state of active development and is liable to breakage. If you notice any such breakage, please check the current [build plan](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues/1) and then generate a new [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaPurtell/webpage/issues) if you think it could be in my blind spot.
